Single Allocation Hub Location Problem Solver
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) code for solving the Single Allocation Hub Location Problem (SAHLP) using two different formulations: path-based and flow-based.

Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository implements two types of formulations for the SAHLP and their two-stage stochastic programs, focusing on demand uncertainty. GAMS models of flow-based and path-based formulations are included, tailored for a problem instance with 25 nodes.
